<p>Prior to the project, I had some idea about pwn but felt that there a lot of gaps in my knowledge and this was a great opportunity to fill those gaps as much as I could.</p>
<p>I have also never coded in C before, but it was not too hard considering most of the time I could just google up to get a better understanding of the C programming syntaxes.</p>
<p>Simply put: I was not good at Pwn.</p>
<p>But every time I say I am not good at something, this scene from Haikyuu always pops in my mind:</p>
<p><img src="/images/compile.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This then got me started.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I have only covered some stack-based concepts and techniques over the span of a few weeks.</p>

<p>While my school did teach basic data structures (PUSH, POP), it was not really helpful since I was not able to put it to practical use&hellip;until now.</p>
<p>To my readers, if you ever attempt to learn pwn, please learn the basics of stack :) It will help you visualise and understand techniques at memory level. Once you are able grasp this fundamental well, it becomes a lot easier to learn different techniques.</p>
<p>Really good resource here: <a href="https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/what-is-the-stack/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CTF101</a></p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://baesenseii.sg/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baesenseii</a> for clearing my misconceptions.</p>

<p>Compiling with different <code>glibc</code> versions will result in having different set of gadgets and functions. A lot of common gadgets like <code>pop rdi ; ret</code> are removed in the newer versions of <code>glibc</code>, which was something I did not know at that point in time. This also makes certain techniques like <code>ret2csu</code> outdated.</p>
<p>This became obvious once I started dealing with <strong>Return-Oriented Programming (ROP).</strong> This is what happens when you try to look for gadgets you can typically find from other programs.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/compile.png" alt="glibc 2.40"></p>
<p>After not being able to figure out how to get the gadgets I wanted for quite awhile, I went to <a href="https://blog.elmo.sg/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elma</a> who is an expert at pwn (Big thank you).</p>

<p>I actually tried both methods. For inline assembly, you can program your code to add gadgets like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e6edf3;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ff7b72">void</span> <span style="color:#d2a8ff;font-weight:bold">gadget</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    __asm__ <span style="color:#ff7b72">volatile</span> (
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#a5d6ff">&#34;pop %rdx</span><span style="color:#79c0ff">\n\t</span><span style="color:#a5d6ff">&#34;</span>  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#a5d6ff">&#34;ret</span><span style="color:#79c0ff">\n\t</span><span style="color:#a5d6ff">&#34;</span>       
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    );
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This adds <code>pop rdx ; ret</code> to the program.</p>
<p>For older compilers, I used Docker to install <code>Ubuntu 18.04</code> image. It does not come with <code>gcc</code> so I downloaded it and saved this container as a new image so I do not need to install <code>gcc</code> everytime I use the image. I also utilised volume mounting which allowed me to directly compile C programs on the host VM.</p>

  3. Buffering

</h3>
<p>When I started testing challenges on remote (Docker), there was no output from my program although I had connected to it.</p>
<p>While this problem also took time, I was able to figure out that it was due to the buffering involved in C programming. This meant that the program output was stored in buffer temporarily until I made an input.</p>
<p>This snippet of code helps to disable buffering, which ensures all I/O &amp; errors are shown immediately:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e6edf3;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#d2a8ff;font-weight:bold">setvbuf</span>(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, <span style="color:#a5d6ff">0</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#d2a8ff;font-weight:bold">setvbuf</span>(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, <span style="color:#a5d6ff">0</span>);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#d2a8ff;font-weight:bold">setvbuf</span>(stderr, NULL, _IONBF, <span style="color:#a5d6ff">0</span>);

<p>During my project, I set aside time to attend this programme and it was really meaningful. It was a privilege to be taught more advanced pwn techniques and also got introduced to kernel exploits (which tbh I still haven&rsquo;t got a clue to how to do it but I can do it soon enough).</p>
<p>I actually attended AYCEP twice before this and there seems to be this trend of me getting rekt in finals CTF (3 consecutive AYCEP finals CTF btw).</p>
<p>Being able solve the pwn challenges during qualifiers&hellip;and not a single one during finals. Truly a humbling experience.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cope.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This time not solving meant a lot more to me since I did my best trying to learn. While I did feel defeated, I continued to try and solve the challenge that I could not right even after the CTF ended (it was a <code>ret2syscall</code> challenge).</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun learning pwn and building pwn challenges. While I acknowledge that I have a little more experience with pwn now, there is still a lot more to it and I hope to continue to learn from people who are way better than I am while teaching others what I know.</p>
